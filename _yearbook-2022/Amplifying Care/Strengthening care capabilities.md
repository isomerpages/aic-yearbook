# Strengthening care capabilities
 **At AIC, we believe that quality care starts with our people. To enrich and invest in the many hands that care for our community, we equip Community Care Organisations (CCOs) with the latest information and resources. From seminars to research-based initiatives for improved care practices, we are committed to reshaping how we transform the lives we collectively touch.**

## Calibrating care strategies
### Community Care Work Plan Seminar

The annual Community Care Work Plan Seminar (CCWPS) serves as a key platform for the Ministry of Health (MOH) and AIC to share the achievements of the Community Care sector and the developments ahead. This helps Community Care partners align, build, and support their goals.

The 7th edition of CCWPS, themed ‘Co-creating a Healthier SG’, was held at Pan Pacific Singapore in June 2022. Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.

### SWIfT study
The Smart Workflow Infrastructure and Technology (SWIfT) aims to improve efficiency in nursing home wards through a comprehensive review of the overall infrastructure design as well as the processes and technologies used.

Five participating nursing homes received reviews and recommended improvements to their layouts and workflows. They were also given suggestions on suitable technological solutions that could be incorporated to improve productivity.
