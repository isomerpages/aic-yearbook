**Message from our Chairman
Dr Gerard Ee and Chief Executive Officer, Mr Tan Kwang Cheak**

As #OneAICFamily, we have emerged stronger from the pandemic. Our priority now is on caring for our ageing population. In a time where rapid medical advancement results in longer lifespans, a key focus is empowering seniors to live well in their golden years, while keeping them healthy and active, so that they can enjoy a good quality of life.

By 2030, it is estimated that one in five people will be above 65 years old based on Singapore’s ageing rate. This statistic adds greater significance to our work, as AIC’s unwavering aim for the past 14 years is to enable all Singaporeans to live well and age gracefully.

Healthier SG, introduced in 2022 and publicly launched in July 2023, seeks to do just that—by empowering Singaporeans to take charge of their health with the support of a dedicated family doctor. Healthier SG represents a national mindset shift from curative to preventive healthcare. For AIC, it marks an exciting development that will propel our vision of building a vibrant care community for all.

As the national care aggregator, we are working closely with community and service partners on the ground. By building an aged care support system we can ensure that seniors and caregivers receive holistic care. With Healthier SG, AIC now has a more precise mandate to strengthen our sector ties further and reinforce care delivery so that our seniors continue to be supported and empowered to age in place.

Already, we are onboarding General Practitioners and equipping them with the resources they need to take on the role of family doctors. At the same time, we are preparing the Community Care sector and Active Ageing Centres to support seniors in following through with their health plans. In tandem, our Silver Generation Office has engaged more than 228,000 seniors through Preventive Health Visits. During the session, we sought to understand their needs, share how Healthier SG can benefit them, and help them with enrolment.

We are thankful for the support rendered by all our partners as we build up networks at the community level to serve as the leverage of Singapore’s care ecosystem. There is no doubt that our Healthier SG journey will need a whole-of-society approach to support the seniors of now and the future successfully. To this end, we are moving towards fulfilling our mission of building a robust and connected care community. We stand ready to adapt and cater to our changing lifestyles, societal norms, and expectations.

As Singapore embraces Healthier SG, AIC is also evolving to ensure that our people are equipped with the future-ready mindset needed to take Singapore forward. Our transformation journey will continue in parallel with, and in full support of, Singapore’s Healthier SG journey. Together, we can build a stronger Singapore and a healthier future for all.
