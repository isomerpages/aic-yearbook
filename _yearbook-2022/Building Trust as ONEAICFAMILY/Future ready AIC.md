# Future-ready AIC
**The world is advancing rapidly, and at AIC, we are mindful of the importance of implementing digital solutions to increase efficiencies and enhance the experience of all those who interact with our services. Ensuring our people thrive with the right tools is vital because, with a future-focused and ready workforce, we will be better positioned to achieve the best care outcomes for our clients.**

## Transforming the way we work
To support our efforts in providing clearer focus on integration, innovation, and alignment across AIC, a new team was set up in July 2022. They take the lead by to synthesis internal culture and engagement initiatives driving business, workforce, and organisation transformation.

At AIC, we constantly review and transform how we work through our people, processes, and systems. To create a future-ready AIC, we have established the AIC Transformation Framework to drive business, workforce, and organisation transformation by:

* Nurturing a 'future-ready' mindset among employees
* Building digital capabilities to streamline processes to improve productivity and service delivery
* Empowering employees to improve their work through competency upskilling and work re-designing

To inculcate a future-ready mindset for transformation and facilitate stronger collaborations throughout AIC, we have implemented various initiatives such as our annual 'Innovation & Learning Fiesta' to help us learn from other organisations about their transformation journey.

To build digital capabilities, we onboarded a suite of digital tools to accelerate the adoption of innovative technology. Our employees have adopted these digital solutions to improve work productivity and service delivery.

To ensure that our employees have the necessary knowledge to leverage these digital tools, we adopted Citizen Developer Strategy, where employees were trained to use various no-code digital tools to streamline their work.
