# Culture & engagement

**Our talents render services and work with various partners to support care services delivery to communities, often going above and beyond their work scopes when certain situations arise. As #OneAICFamily, we deeply care for them and are always finding new ways to engage, encourage, and support our enablers in transforming Community Care in Singapore. Our people are at the heart of our work, and we are committed to creating an environment where they are empowered to be their best.**

## AIC 2022 Homecoming
With the Work Away from Office policy launched, we needed to continue to reconnect, re-engage, and strengthen our connections as #OneAICFamily. 

As part of our efforts to facilitate team engagement and interaction, a Signature Teambuilding programme named “AIC 2022 Homecoming” was developed. It consisted of experiential activities and team learning. The programme saw nearly 1,200 staff attending the multiple half-day teambuilding sessions across the three months from July to September 2022. 

Held at the HomeTeamNS Khatib complex, activities included:
* Scaling the multi-installation indoor adventure centre together as a team.
* Shooting for the highest combined scores at the airsoft station.
* A finale event where teams performed to create musical beats together as one at the 'Heart of Care' drumming segment.
