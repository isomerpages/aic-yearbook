# Employee engagement
**We deeply care for our people – AIC’s enablers in transforming the Community Care landscape in Singapore. Our talents render care services and work with various community partners to support the delivery of care services to many communities, often going above and beyond their normal work scopes when certain situations require them to. Our people are at the heart of our work, and we are committed to creating an environment where they are supported to do their best.**

## AIC 2022 Homecoming
With the Work Away from Office policy launched, we needed to continue to reconnect, re-engage, and strengthen our connections as #OneAICFamily. 

As part of our efforts to facilitate team engagement and interaction, a Signature Teambuilding programme named “AIC 2022 Homecoming” was developed. It consisted of experiential activities and team learning. The programme saw nearly 1,200 staff attending the multiple half-day teambuilding sessions across the three months from July to September 2022. 

Held at the HomeTeamNS Khatib complex, activities included scaling the multi-installation indoor adventure centre together as a team, shooting for the highest combined scores at the airsoft station, and a finale event where teams performed to create musical beats together as one at the “Heart of Care” drumming segment.

## Well-being initiatives
We ae committed to building a workforce prioritising a caring culture for all employees. With the 'culture of care' as our key objective, we developed strategies to inculcate a well-being mindset among staff. 

A holistic well-being framework - encompassing pillars of Environment, Mental/Emotional, Physical, and Social - guides the programmes and initiatives we implemented. Our leadership team also signed a pledge in 2022 to demonstrate their collective commitment to employee well-being at work. At the same time, a Well-being Steering Committee was formed to drive the overall strategic and holistic approach to the well-being of AIC staff. 

Peer Support Network 
Peer Support Network (PSN) is a formalised group of close to 60 staff volunteers within AIC who have stepped up to serve their colleagues by offering basic counselling support. They are committed to supporting AIC’s various mental well-being efforts. Staff who need a listening ear may contact PSN for emotional support. 

In commemoration of World Mental Health Day 2022, the peer supporters participated in 'Connecting through Art', an initiative for peer-to-peer bonding. A post-event survey found that overall, participants favoured the session and found the initiative 'very meaningful', and some felt it was a beneficial opportunity for self-discovery.

## Employee Assistance Programme
Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) is a resource where external counsellors are engaged for our staff to go for counselling. As part of commemorating World Mental Health Day 2022, an EAP counsellor also hosted a lunchtime talk for AIC's staff.

## AIC Wellness Studio
AIC’s Wellness Studio is a dedicated resource designed to provide a space for staff to have some 'me-time'. The space is available for staff to use to relax and refresh while at work, and is especially set up with thematic posters and fitted with comfortable chair and lounges in soothing colours.

## Kopi Chats and AIC in Conversation
Throughout the year, our employees had opportunities to engage senior leaders in informal dialogue at 'AIC in Conversation' and 'Kopi Chat Live' sessions.

'AIC in Conversation' allows employee voices to be heard while giving leaders a better understanding of ground sentiments. Staff have a chance to virtually meet up with our CEO Mr Tan Kwang Cheak, and other senior leaders at 'Kopi Chat Live', which is hosted on AIC's online Workplace platform. These hour-long sessions keep employees updated on the latest happenings within the organisation, learn more about the leaders' perspectives, and provide opportunities for them to raise questions or share their thoughts.

Through having various purpose-driven programmes at AIC, we strive to enable our people to find meaning in their daily work and learn from each other. Our aim is to create a conducive environment where we build their capabilities and shape their characters to positively impact the communities we serve. We recognise that our end goal starts with nurturing our people – giving them a well-rounded perspective of AIC’s work and due opportunities for career development.
