# Future-ready AIC
**The world is advancing at a rapid pace. At AIC, we are mindful of the importance of implementing digital solutions to increase efficiencies and enhance the experience of all those who interact with our services. Ensuring our people thrive with the right tools is important because, with a future-focused and ready workforce, we will be better positioned to achieve the best care outcomes for our clients.**

## Transforming the way we work
To support our efforts in providing clearer focus on integration, innovation, and alignment across AIC, a new team was set up in July 2022. They take the lead by to synthesis internal culture and engagement initiatives driving business, workforce, and organisation transformation.

To inculcate a future-ready mindset for transformation and facilitate stronger collaborations through understanding how various parts of the organisation work, we have implemented various initiatives such as 'Walk in Your Shoes' for staff. Learning Journeys to partner organisations and the annual 'Innovation & Learning Fiesta' help us learn from other organisations about their transformation journey. 

To build digital capabilities, we on-boarded a suite of digital tools to accelerate the adoption of innovative technology. Our employees have adopted these digital solutions to improve work productivity and service delivery.
 
To ensure that our employees are equipped with the necessary knowledge to leverage on these digital tools, we adopted Citizen Developer Strategy, where employees were trained to use various no-code digital tools to streamline their work.  

## Enhancing cybersecurity
Technological advances continue to march ahead and at AIC, we understand the importance of protecting ourselves against the various threats that continue to emerge. Strengthening the organisation’s cyber security awareness serves to not only ourselves, but the information of our clients, who we consider the core of the work we do.

## Cybersecurity Awareness Programme
All AIC staff are kept up to date on their cybersecurity know-how by being required to undergo Cybersecurity Awareness training about ICT Security Policy and Acceptable Use Policy on a yearly basis via e-learning modules. 

New staff also undergo training on Cybersecurity Awareness as part of their orientation programme. Tips reminding staff on good cyber hygiene practices are also periodically shared via e-bulletins, screen savers, and posters.

A series of Cyber Week activities such as ‘Online Cyber Games’, ‘Guess the Cyber Emoji Contest’, and ‘Cyber Stickies’ were organised to raise cyber awareness among staff in a fun and interactive way.

AIC staff also underwent phishing simulations and supported two phishing simulation exercises for the Healthcare sector.

AIC Board Members and the senior leadership team attended a workshop on cyber governance and business continuity training. Table-top exercises were also organised to assess and train the Incident Management Council’s responses in the event of crises.

In supporting the Community Care sector, we have also developed the Cybersecurity Skills and Competency Framework and supported the launch of the Community Care Digital Transformation Plan. To raise cybersecurity awareness, three Cyber Webinars were organised for participants to gain more insights on social engineering, PDPA, and business continuity planning as part of AIC’s Cyber Week.

## Open Government Product (OGP) HealthTech Sprint
AIC attended the OGP HealthTech Sprint in March 2023 to leverage on a couple of initiatives, such as OGP CheckFirst, FormSG, sgID, and forms.sg to streamline the following processes:

* Senior Mobility Fund (SMF) Applications 
* Caregiver Training Grant (CTG) Training Provider Applications and feedback management
