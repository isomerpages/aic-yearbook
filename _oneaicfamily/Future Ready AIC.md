# Future-Ready AIC
**The world is advancing at a rapid pace. At AIC, we are mindful of the importance of implementing digital solutions to increase efficiencies and enhance the experience of all those who interact with our services. Ensuring our people thrive with the right tools is important because, with a future-focused and ready workforce, we will be better positioned to achieve the best care outcomes for our clients.**

## Transforming The Way We Work
To support our efforts in providing clearer focus on integration, innovation, and alignment across AIC, a new team was set up in July 2022. They take the lead by to synthesis internal culture and engagement initiatives driving business, workforce, and organisation transformation.

To inculcate a future-ready mindset for transformation and facilitate stronger collaborations through understanding how various parts of the organisation work, we have implemented various initiatives such as 'Walk in Your Shoes' for staff. Learning Journeys to partner organisations and the annual 'Innovation & Learning Fiesta' help us learn from other organisations about their transformation journey. 

To build digital capabilities, we on-boarded a suite of digital tools to accelerate the adoption of innovative technology. Our employees have adopted these digital solutions to improve work productivity and service delivery.
 
To ensure that our employees are equipped with the necessary knowledge to leverage on these digital tools, we adopted Citizen Developer Strategy, where employees were trained to use various no-code digital tools to streamline their work.  

## Launch of Microsoft 365
As part of AIC's continuous efforts in driving organisational transformation, we were an early adopter of the Microsoft 365 suite of applications among the Ministry of Healthâ€™s (MOH) healthcare clusters and entities.
