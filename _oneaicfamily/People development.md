# People development
**As an organisation, AIC has grown from strength to strength, gradually expanding our capabilities and functions to deliver quality care services and positively impact communities. To support AIC’s growth, we are investing in our people through initiatives to support their personal and career growth in their journey with us. My CAREer@AIC gives staff a one-stop platform to gain a holistic overview of the business and the career development possibilities at AIC. Meanwhile, initiatives such as ‘Walk In Your Shoes’ and the ‘Innovation & Learning Fiesta’ encourage inter-department learning and engagement, driving teamwork and collaboration. We also continuously refresh the onboarding experience for new joiners to inspire our younger talents to endeavour for excellence, unity, and understanding.**

## My CAREer@AIC
At AIC, we see endless possibilities in our people. We enable our people to take ownership of their development and explore various career paths by providing them with the right opportunities and tools.

With this belief, we continued to up the ante in our career development efforts by introducing My CAREer@AIC in 2022. The career microsite serves as a one-stop platform for employees to browse information on AIC’s career development framework, explore career paths, check out career opportunities, and get inspired by fellow colleagues’ stories that share their journeys with AIC.

## The ‘Walk In Your Shoes’ initiative
'Walk In Your Shoes' is an AIC initiative for divisions and departments to host staff learning sessions. This was implemented in response to staff's feedback seeking opportunities for more cross-department learning and engagement sessions. The series intended to foster stronger collaborations between departments.

Staff who participated gave positive feedback, as these sessions provided them with the opportunity to learn from one another, find areas for partnership, and spark a new appreciation for each other's work.

## Innovation & Learning Fiesta
As part of our efforts to drive innovation, we held our annual Innovation & Learning Fiesta in November 2022. The fiesta was its third year and drew participants from MOH and the public healthcare clusters.  
  
Themed 'Future Ready Workforce, Future Ready AIC', the programme highlights comprised talks by external speakers to inspire or provide a glimpse of their organisation's transformation experience. There was also a series of workshops to introduce tools and frameworks based on daily topics identified – Service, Process and People Innovation.  

The week-long fiesta proved to be an educational experience for AIC's staff and guests, offering everyone valuable learnings which they could glean from and then apply in their work.

## #AICanvas employee onboarding programme
As we emerged from the pandemic in 2022, we saw the opportunity to reimagine our employee onboarding programme as we pivot to new ways of working, learning, and bonding.

We developed a signature programme with uniquely AIC elements, where the modules anchored on our Employee Value Proposition – Family, Purpose, and Growth. Underpinned by clear objectives with empowered learning for personal reflections and internalisation, the programme provides employees with greater integration, connectivity, and support even before their first day with AIC.

As these new colleagues assimilate to the #OneAICFamily, we hope that they can reimagine their career in the Community Care sector and add their own colour to the canvas that is our mission and strategic priorities.
