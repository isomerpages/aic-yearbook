# Strengthening care capabilities
**At AIC, we believe that quality care starts with our people. To enrich and invest in the many hands that care for our community, we equip them with the latest information and resources. From seminars to research-based initiatives for improved care practices, we are committed to reshaping how we transform the lives we collectively touch.**

## Calibrating Care Strategies
### Community Care Work Plan Seminar

The annual Community Care Work Plan Seminar (CCWPS) serves as a key platform for MOH and AIC to share the achievements of the Community Care sector and the developments ahead. This helps Community Care partners align, build, and support their goals.

The 7th edition of CCWPS, themed ‘Co-creating a Healthier SG’, was held at Pan Pacific Singapore in June 2022. Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.

Partners benefitted from the in-depth panel discussions addressing ‘Collaborating with Healthcare Clusters for a Stronger Community Care’ and took part actively in the Question-and-Answer sessions. There were also keynote speeches on ‘Celebrating Collaborations with Friends of Community Care’ and ‘Empowering the Community Care Sector for a Healthier SG’.

### Community Care SPRINT Forum 2022
Organised by AIC, the four-day Community Care SPRINT Forum (CCSF) focuses on supporting the Community Care sector’s continued emphasis on improving quality and productivity, digitalisation efforts, people development, and process innovation. 

With the theme ‘Reimagining the Future of Community Care with Healthier SG’, the programme explored new ways of delivering quality care in an evolving ecosystem.  

Various relevant topics were shared at the forum, including Japan’s experience managing an ageing society, corporate CapitaLand’s strategy in leading their organisation through change and uncertainty, the latest innovations from the Community Care sector and more.

### Community Care Digital Transformation Plan
The Community Care Digital Transformation Plan (CCDTP) is a structured framework that aims to uplift digitalisation rates and enhance productivity and job satisfaction levels in Community Care Organisations (CCO). CCDTP was unveiled by AIC at its 2022 CCWPS. This new initiative aims to boost the adoption of digital solutions among partners in the sector to render better support to seniors and clients in the community.

### SWIfT study
The Smart Workflow Infrastructure and Technology (SWIfT) aims to improve efficiency in nursing home wards through a comprehensive review of the overall infrastructure design as well as the processes and technologies used.

Five participating nursing homes received reviews and recommended improvements to their layouts and workflows. They were also given suggestions on suitable technological solutions that could be incorporated to improve productivity.

We are working with MOH on changes in care model and regulations, as well as to rethink the design of next-generation nursing homes. This is all with the goal of promoting greater process efficiency in the future.

### Clinical Quality Improvement collaborative
The Clinical Quality Improvement Collaborative (CQI) is a joint effort by AIC and nursing homes to improve resident safety and quality of care, as well as to facilitate the spread of good practices within and across organisations.
