# Strengthening Care Capabilities
**At AIC, we believe that quality care starts with people. To enrich and invest in the many hands that care for our community, we equip our teams with the latest information and resources. From seminars to research-based initiatives for improved safety and care practices, we are committed to reshaping the work that goes into transforming the many lives we collectively touch.**

## Calibrating Care Strategies
### Community Care Work Plan Seminar
The annual Community Care Work Plan Seminar (CCWPS) serves as a key platform for MOH and AIC to share the achievements of the Community Care sector and the key developments ahead. This helps Community Care partners align, build, and support their goals.

The 7th edition of CCWPS, themed ‘Co-creating a Healthier SG’, was held at Pan Pacific Singapore in June 2022. Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.

Partners benefitted from the in-depth panel discussions addressing “Collaborating with Healthcare Clusters for a Stronger Community Care” and took part actively in the following question and answer sessions. There were also keynote speeches about “Celebrating Collaborations with Friends of Community Care and Empowering the Community Care Sector for a Healthier SG”.

### Community Care Digital Transformation Plan
The Community Care Digital Transformation Plan (CCDTP) is a structured framework that aims to uplift digitalisation rates and enhance productivity and job satisfaction levels in Community Care Organisations (CCO). CCDTP was unveiled by AIC at its 2022 CCWPS. This new initiative aims to boost the adoption of digital solutions among partners in the sector to render better support to seniors and clients in the community.

### SWIfT Study
The Smart Workflow Infrastructure and Technology (SWIfT) aims to improve efficiency in nursing home wards through a comprehensive review of the overall infrastructure design as well as the processes and technologies used.

Five participating nursing homes received reviews and recommended improvements to their layouts and workflows. They were also given suggestions on suitable technological solutions that could be incorporated to improve productivity.
