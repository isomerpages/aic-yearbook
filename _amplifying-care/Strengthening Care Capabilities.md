# Strengthening Care Capabilities
**At AIC, we believe that quality care starts with people. To enrich and invest in the many hands that care for our community, we equip our teams with the latest information and resources. From seminars to research-based initiatives for improved safety and care practices, we are committed to reshaping the work that goes into transforming the many lives we collectively touch.**

## Calibrating Care Strategies
### Community Care Work Plan Seminar
The annual Community Care Work Plan Seminar (CCWPS) serves as a key platform for MOH and AIC to share the achievements of the Community Care sector and the key developments ahead. This helps Community Care partners align, build, and support their goals.

The 7th edition of CCWPS, themed ‘Co-creating a Healthier SG’, was held at Pan Pacific Singapore in June 2022. Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour.
