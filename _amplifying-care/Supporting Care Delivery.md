# Supporting Care Delivery

**Our people and systems deliver quality care to communities all around Singapore. We always strive to incorporate better methods and strategies to improve our initiatives, workflows, and processes to meet the needs of our population. With these consistent developments, we strengthen Singaporeâ€™s capabilities to create vibrant engagements through our network of Community Care Organisations.**

## Making Care Better

Named AIConnect@Workplace, it is a central node for all partners in the Community Care sector to access the latest information, and tap on a repository of healthcare resources and guides. The channel enables partners to engage and connect with one another and share news.

In January 2023, AIConnect@Workplace celebrated its first birthday at an event that featured sharing sessions by Meta and our own staff on driving engagement on the channel. For the year ahead, AIConnect@Workplace will drive engagement using an elevated content strategy, with posts to engage the sector deeper and increase membership numbers of the channel.

### OurSG Grants Portal

AIC is transiting to OurSG Grant Portal (OSG), a centralised, whole-of-government grant processing portal developed by GovTech. 
 
OSG provides capabilities to simplify grant administration and improve the service experience for our care providers, as they can follow the same workflow for various schemes administered by different ministries and agencies. 

Since October 2022, we have successfully onboarded three grants onto OSG. The remaining sector grants will be onboarded progressively and is expected to be completed by March 2025.

## CareConnect
CareConnect is a secure, digital platform to engage Active Ageing Centre (AAC) providers with the latest information and resources. AAC providers also use the platform to submit their progress reports, which makes submissions easy and helps to reduce errors.
