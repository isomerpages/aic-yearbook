# Supporting care delivery

**Our people and systems deliver quality care to communities all around Singapore. As such, AIC continuously strives to incorporate better methods and strategies to improve our initiatives, workflows, and processes to meet the care our population needs. Through constant development, we are strengthening Singaporeâ€™s capabilities to create vibrant engagements with seniors through our network of Community Care Organisations.**

## OurSG Grants Portal

AIC is transiting to OurSG Grant Portal (OSG), a centralised, whole-of-government grant processing portal developed by GovTech. 
 
OSG provides capabilities to simplify grant administration and improve the service experience for our care providers, as they can follow the same workflow for various schemes administered by different ministries and agencies. 

Since October 2022, we have successfully onboarded three grants onto OSG. The remaining sector grants will be onboarded progressively and is expected to be completed by March 2025.

## CareConnect Phase 2A

CareConnect is a secure, digital platform to engage Active Ageing Centre (AAC) providers with the latest information and resources. AAC providers also use the platform to submit their progress reports, which makes submissions easy and helps to reduce errors.

In 2022, all AACs started using CareConnect to submit their Progress Reports to AIC. Resources and past webinar records can also be found via the platform for easy retrieval.

## Good Practices Handbooks
AIC developed the Good Practices Handbooks (GPHs) with inputs from workgroups representing the Community Care sector and an advisory panel comprising members from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the community. GPHs articulate realistic and achievable day-to-day practices of quality care, above and beyond Service Requirements.

Service providers are encouraged to work towards adopting the good practices advocated in the handbooks in the next three to five years to raise the overall quality of care within the sector. Concurrently, AIC is developing resources to encourage adoption among providers through e-learning

modules on specific topics, infographics and videos, and thematic sharing sessions.

We are looking to broaden our range of activity resources to provide more support to seniors, Community Care staff, and caregivers, to enrich their engagements.

## Community Silver Trust

## Launch of FUN! Fund
Launched in November 2022, the FUN! Fund was co-developed by AIC and The Community Foundation of Singapore. It supports innovative ideas that engage seniors to improve their well-being, be socially active, and have fun.
