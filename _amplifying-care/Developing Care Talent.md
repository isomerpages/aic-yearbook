# Developing Care Talent
**While we continue to uphold our vision to create a vibrant care community in Singapore, our mission to invest in the people that are part of our Care Community remains unchanged. We have paid close attention to training, equipping, and developing our various talent pools, ensuring we have clear career pathways and development programmes in place. After all, shaping the next generation of leaders in Community Care only serves to further strengthen the care network and improve capabilities, service delivery, and care quality.**

## Employment Facilitation Initiatives

A suite of employment facilitation initiatives for the Community Care sector was implemented to facilitate employment of locals to meet capacity expansions. 

These initiatives tie in with AIC’s strategic objectives of securing a productive and skilled workforce, with a strong local core. These initiatives have also facilitated the Manpower Recruitment and Training Initiative (MRTI), Senior Management Associate Scheme (SMAS), and on-going recruitment and publicity efforts.

## Community Care Job Redesign Initiative
The Job Redesign (JR) initiative for the Community Care sector evaluates and if required, redesigns support care roles, which are critical to the smooth delivery of care services within the field. The aim of JR is to create higher value-adding roles that combine different care skills and functions, to encourage cross-deployment and multi-skilling of staff. 

From the initiative, support care staff will have more options to build on and advance their careers in Community Care.

The pilot proved that the redesigned roles were largely successful across different care settings. MOH and AIC then moved on to conduct a second phase of the JR project, which commenced from August 2022.  

Ren Ci Hospital, NTUC Health and St Luke's Eldercare will continue JR in the Early Adopter phase with two key objectives:
* Scale up the adoption of the two redesigned roles, CCA and SCCA, and
* Implement higher-level roles which are (i) Community Care Executive (CCE) and Community Care Manager (CCM).

## Community Care SPRINT Forum 2022
Organised by AIC, the four-day Community Care SPRINT Forum (CCSF) focuses on supporting the Community Care sector’s continued emphasis to further improve quality and productivity, digitalisation efforts, people development, and process innovation. 

With the theme ‘Reimagining the Future of Community Care with Healthier SG’, the programme line-up explored new ways of delivering quality care in an evolving ecosystem.  
 
Various relevant topics were shared at the forum, including Japan’s experience in managing an ageing society, CapitaLand’s strategy in leading their organisation through change and uncertainty, various innovations from the Community Care sector and more.
