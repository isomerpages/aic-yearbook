# Building a future-ready AIC

## Community Care Job Redesign Initiative
The Job Redesign (JR) initiative for the Community Care sector evaluates and redesigns support care roles, which are critical to the smooth delivery of care services within the field. The aim of JR is to create higher value-adding roles that combine different care skills and functions and to encourage cross-deployment and multi-skilling of staff. 

From the initiative, support care staff will have more options to build on and advance their careers in Community Care.

The pilot proved that the redesigned roles were largely successful across different care settings. MOH and AIC then moved on to conduct a second phase of the JR project, which commenced from August 2022.

Ren Ci Hospital, NTUC Health, and St Luke's Eldercare will continue JR in the Early Adopter phase with two key objectives:
* Scale up the adoption of the two redesigned roles, CCA and SCCA, and
* Implement higher-level roles which are (i) Community Care Executive (CCE) and Community Care Manager (CCM).

*In November 2022, Ren Ci Hospital formally launched their Community Care Associate Scheme by formally appointing the first batch of 220 CCAs at a JR graduation ceremony.*

## Clinical Quality Improvement Collaborative
The Clinical Quality Improvement Collaborative (CQI) is a joint effort by AIC and nursing homes to improve resident safety and quality of care, as well as to facilitate the spread of good practices within and across organisations.
