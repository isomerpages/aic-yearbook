# Driving Talent Development

**We continue to focus on enriching our people's talent pool and bench strength through various leadership programmes and initiatives. We are paying close attention to training, equipping, and developing different talent pools, ensuring clear career pathways and development programmes are in place for them. We launched a structured pathway for Senior Nurses and Nurse Managers to prepare them for leadership positions and an enhanced AIC Learning Network with courses that will benefit our workforce and Community Care partners.

## A Culture Of Learning
### Making care better

Named AIConnect@Workplace, it is a central node for all partners in the Community Care sector to access the latest information, and tap on a repository of healthcare resources and guides. The channel enables partners to engage and connect with one another and share news.

In January 2023, AIConnect@Workplace celebrated its first birthday at an event that featured sharing sessions by Meta and our own staff on driving engagement on the channel. For the year ahead, AIConnect@Workplace will drive engagement using an elevated content strategy, with posts to engage the sector deeper and increase membership numbers of the channel.

### AIC learning network

Since the launch of the Community Care Learning Management System (CCLMS) to encourage self-directed e-learning, we have streamlined and improved the user experience to meet the needs of sector workforce through annual system enhancements. New enhancements will be rolled out to improve user management functionality and governance in alignment to SkillsFuture Singapore’s Continuing Education and Training Grants Governance Framework. 

With Community Care partners committed to continually developing their people, more than 14,100 training places were filled. This is equivalent to about 7 in 10 of the sector’s manpower attending training offered by the AIC Learning Network.

## Developing Tomorrow's Leaderes

### Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme
The Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme (CCNLP) was developed to facilitate succession planning and strengthen the pipeline of nursing leaders for the Community Care sector. It aims to build up the nursing leadership bench strength through a structured pathway.

Since January 2022, AIC has facilitated CCNLP peer networking sessions for successfully on-boarded nursing talents to bond, share their experiences, and network with dedicated AIC Talent Partners. The sessions are held every quarter and include dialogues with nursing leaders on their leadership journeys. Nursing talents can have meaningful conversations on any queries or concerns regarding their journeys.

Additionally, MOH and AIC are also working with participating CCOs to develop Individual Development Plans to track the development and progression of their nursing talents in accordance with the Community Nursing Competency Framework.

### AIC leadership-building programmes
The IMPACT and INSIGHT Leadership programmes are part of AIC’s initiatives to provide customised programmes to grow the leadership pipeline and bench strength in the Community Care sector. More than 100 leaders and managers have attended and benefitted from these Leadership Milestone programmes. 

AIC sends one leader from the Community Care sector each year to attend Harvard Business School’s Strategic Perspective in Non-profit Management programme. This programme is a partnership between the Harvard Singapore Foundation and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

Targeted at top executives of non-profits, the programme explores crucial concepts and skills for non-profit leadership. It also looks into strengthening management and accountability while leading the evolution for a more responsive, successful, and sustainable organisation.

### Employment facilitation initiatives
AIC has implemented a suite of employment facilitation initiatives for the Community Care sector to facilitate the employment of locals to meet capacity expansions. 

These initiatives align with AIC’s strategic objectives of securing a productive, skilled workforce with a solid local core. These initiatives have also facilitated the Manpower Recruitment and Training Initiative (MRTI), Senior Management Associate Scheme (SMAS), and ongoing recruitment and publicity efforts.

The National Awards (COVID-19) are special State Awards introduced to recognise individuals and teams who have made outstanding contributions to Singapore’s national effort against the pandemic.
