# Supporting seniors
**We expend every effort to care for our seniors, be it through on-going programmes that cater to their needs, such as Meals on Wheels, or by rolling out new initiatives, such as the Communities of Care pilot. Each enhancement to the existing support for our seniors is achieved by ramping up service delivery and raising awareness of Singapore’s ageing population through new partnerships.**

## Caring for their needs
### Meals on Wheels

AIC conducts assessments on MOW service to help identify and close any gaps in the meal preparation and delivery process.

### Community Case Management Service
In 2022, the Cluster Support (CS) programme was streamlined into the Community Case Management Service (CCMS) to provide support to seniors in the community who have difficulties managing their health and social care needs.

## Living well, ageing well
### Communities of Care
The pilot of AIC’s Communities of Care (CoC) programme was held from 2019 to 2023. Called ‘CoC 1.0’, it was developed to strengthen the construction of a place-based care ecosystem.

Through the pilot, various care providers worked together to create service networks by location, to best serve seniors within each community. Leveraging on each other’s strengths and resources enabled them to boost service delivery and gain valuable learnings.

With learnings from CoC 1.0, we developed a more structured approach for the construction of a localised care ecosystem known as CoC 2.0. The Tote Board Community Health Fund (TBCHF) has also committed to supporting the running CoC for another three years, from 2023 to 2026.
 
More pilot sites will be involved in CoC 2.0 for testing and adaptation of the strategies developed by the providers. The objective of this second chapter would be to create and implement a playbook that will support the scalability and replicability of building CoCs across all Active Aging Centres (AACs) island wide.

### Recruiting Silver Generation Ambassadors
From September to November 2022, a Recruitment Campaign was rolled out to strengthen our Silver Generation Office’s (SGO) current pool of Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGA). The campaign’s multi-touch amplification included displaying quotes from existing SGAs on Digital Display Panels at Housing Development Board estates, television screens at food courts and coffee shops, and across social media platforms, such as SGO’s Facebook and YouTube channels.

### Collaboration with NUS
In view of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population and their increasingly diverse needs, SGO collaborated with the National University of Singapore (NUS), to lead a pilot module ‘GEN2061: Support Healthy Ageing SG’. 

As part of NUS’ Communities & Engagement Pillar, the module seeks to impart the fundamental concepts of volunteerism and enhance students’ understanding of helping seniors in their community age healthily.

### Enhancing Activity Access for Frailer Seniors
Physical, cognitive, and social activities bring well-being to everyone; however, access to suitable, meaningful activities for frailer seniors can be a challenge.

To better enable frailer seniors’ participation in activities, AIC worked with partners to curate activities suitable for their interests and abilities at two key national events in 2022. 

### Intergenerational Programmes
AIC actively collaborates with PCF Sparkletots and the Early Childhood Development Agency on programmes that bring young and old together. Through the AIC-PCF Intergenerational Programme and the national ‘Start Small, Dream Big’ (SSDB) initiative seniors are able to build bonds and foster a deeper understanding between different generations and backgrounds through meaningful activities.

Over the year, our intergenerational programmes saw an expansion in the number of collaborations between our key partners. We also increased engagement opportunities with Community Care Organisations (CCOs) through activities between pre-schoolers and seniors. Compared to 2021, the number of engagements for both the AIC-PCF and SSDB initiatives have increased in 2022.

## Providing financial assistance
### Enhanced Seniors’ Mobility & Enabling Fund
The Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) provides holistic support for seniors to age in place within the community.

### Enhanced CHAS outreach

To encourage more people to sign up for CHAS uptake in 2022, AIC ran a multi-pronged digital campaign in July and August, raising awareness on the expansion of the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). 

The campaign comprised a [collaboration with SGAG](https://www.facebook.com/378167172198277/posts/6168298316518438/), TikTok videos, and advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. Additionally, [a series of blog articles](https://aic-blog.com/chronic-condition-management) featuring a patient with chronic condition and a CHAS General Practitioner was published and amplified on AIC’s social channels. The [CHAS Portal](https://www.chas.sg/) was also given a refreshed look in May 2022 to improve user experience.

Additionally, we worked with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to weave in the Healthier SG messaging in our social media advertisements in March 2023. A TikTok video featuring a senior encouraging caregivers to assist their parents and grandparents to apply for CHAS was also produced ahead of Healthier SG’s launch in July.
