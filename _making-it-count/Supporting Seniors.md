# Supporting seniors
**We continued our efforts to care for our seniors, whether it is through on-going programmes that cater to their needs, such as Meals on Wheels, or by rolling out new initiatives, such as the Communities of Care Pilot to inject vibrancy into our various service channels. We continue to enhance currently available support for our seniors in order to ramp up service delivery and raise awareness of Singapore’s ageing population through partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learning and our network of dedicated partners.**

## Caring for their needs
### Meals on Wheels
> Last year, our Meals on Wheels (MOW) programme served approximately 4,200 clients, with 8,400 meals being served daily.
> 
> Interim MOW support for seniors on COVID-19 home quarantine continued and one notable achievement was the successful coordination to serve 35 seniors within a turnaround time of less than 24 hours.
> 
> We reviewed the MOW initiative and plans were made to expand our capacity. In October, we launched an island wide RFP to award contracts to X  more service providers.

> Our objectives:
>	1.	Increase our capacity to meet demand, which is projected to increase by 32% by 2025.
> 
>	2.	Reduce the risk of service disruption by onboarding more service providers per region; most regions are currently served by one service provider.
> 
>	3.	Enhance and align MOW’s service scope in various areas such as our funding model, service eligibility criteria, internal operations, and meals’ dietary scope, following Ministry of Health’s (MOH) nutritional guidelines.

### Food Hygiene & Safety Assessment
While Meals on Wheels (MOW) service providers, which are Social Service Agencies (SSA), do not need to be licensed by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), we conducted audits to help identify any gaps in the meal preparation and delivery process.

> 
> In 2022: 
> 
> 6 MOW service providers were audited across 9 sites: 5 are operating in-house kitchens and 4 procured meals from licensed food caterers.
> 
> MOW’s service providers showed significant improvements in the food and site safety compliance rate, increasing from 78% in 2021 to 94% in 2022.

The number of major and critical findings have decreased, due our service providers’ continuous efforts to improve their facilities and reinforce good personal hygiene in their day-to-day operations.

### Community Case Management Service

The Community Case Management Service (CCMS) and Cluster Support (CS) programme share many similarities; they provide support to seniors in the community who have difficulties managing their health and social care needs. AIC has been working with MOH to review the community case management landscape and a decision was made streamlined both programmes into one.

> In 2022, a revised CCMS model was rolled out, and existing seniors under CS were onboarded to the new programme, ensuring service continuity.
> 
> The revised CCMS model saw an increase in the number of service providers from 6 to 13 in total. 
> 
> About 3,000 seniors will benefit from the Community Case Management Service programme in 2022.

## Living well, ageing well

### Communities of Care Pilot

The pilot of AIC’s Communities of Care (CoC) programme will run from 2019 to 2023. Called ‘CoC 1.0’, it was developed to strengthen the construction of a place-based care ecosystem. 

> 2019 to 2022 
> CoC 1.0 involved more than 2,000 seniors in SOPs proposed by 13 care providers

In CoC 1.0, various care providers worked together to create service networks by location, to best serve seniors within each community. Leveraging on each other’s strengths and resources enabled them to boost service delivery and gain valuable learnings.

With learnings from CoC 1.0, AIC has developed a more structured approach for the construction of a localised care ecosystem. For CoC 2.0, AIC has secured support from the Tote Board Community Health Fund (TBCHF) to continue running CoC for another 3 years, from 2023 to 2026.
 
More pilot sites will be involved in CoC 2.0 for testing and adaptation of the strategies developed by the providers. The objective of the second chapter of CoC would be to create and implement a playbook that will support the scalability and replicability of building CoCs across all Active Aging Centres (AACs) island wide. 

### SGO’s Recruitment Campaign

From September to November 2022, a Recruitment Campaign was rolled out to strengthen Silver Generation Office’s (SGO) current pool of SGAs. The campaign’s multi-touch amplification included displaying quotes from existing SGAs on Digital Display Panels at HDB blocks, TV screens at food courts and coffee shops, and across social media platforms, such as SGO’s Facebook and YouTube channels.

> The Recruitment Campaign’s media efforts garnered over 37 million impressions and resulted in more than 162,000 clicks to the campaign’s webpage.

> Content by partnering KOLs reached over 130,000 of their followers, creating more than 6,000 engagements.

> Overall, SGO’s 2022 Recruitment Campaign generated about 1,100 interested volunteer sign-ups in 6 weeks, a 10-fold increase from pre-campaign numbers.

SGO also worked with local Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) like Belinda Lee, Chen Xi, Sujimy, Nurul Aini, and Guna, to further the campaign’s reach on social media. The KOLs contributed to the recruitment narrative by adding their own perspectives and documenting the journey of real-life SGAs, from receiving training to engaging seniors.

### Collaboration with NUS

In view of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population and their increasingly diverse needs, SGO collaborated with the National University of Singapore (NUS), to lead a pilot module, ‘GEN2061: Support Healthy Ageing SG’. 

As part of NUS’ Communities & Engagement Pillar, the module seeks to impart the fundamental concepts of volunteerism and enhance students’ understanding of helping seniors in their community age healthily.

> From August 2022 to February 2023, students were trained by SGO staff to qualify as SGAs and conduct 60 to 80 hours of engagement with seniors as part of the module’s requirements. 

> The pilot module attracted 51 students in the first run, and 146 students in its second run, more than doubling the number of the initial intake.

In anticipation of seniors’ increasing care needs, SGO is currently actively reaching out to various Institutes of Higher Learning to engage students on the important role they play in Singapore’s ageing population landscape.

### Book feature: Singapore Ageing

SGO made its reach in the sphere of academia through SGO Tampines’ Deputy Head, Andrew Sim’s contribution to the book, ‘Singapore Ageing: Issues and Challenges Ahead’.

Andrew researched and co-authored a chapter called ‘Building a Social Network for Older Adults: A Nation-wide Initiative by the Singapore Silver Generation Office’. He wrote the text with Dr Corrine Ghoh, an Associate Professor from the Department of Social Work in NUS. The chapter chronicles the evolution of the Silver Generation Office and the positive impact it has made since its inception, through promoting positive ageing for the well-being of seniors in Singapore. 

The book, published by leading academic publisher World Scientific, serves as a useful resource for local students and international scholars who are interested in the socio-political discourse on ageing in Singapore.

### Enhancing Activity Access for Frailer Seniors

Physical, cognitive, and social activities bring well-being to everyone; however, access to suitable, meaningful activities for frailer seniors can be a challenge. 

To better enable frailer seniors’ participation in activities, AIC worked with partners to curate activities suitable for their interests and abilities at two key national events in 2022.

## Promoting Intergenerational Engagement

### Intergenerational Programmes

The intergenerational collaborations under the AIC-PCF Intergenerational Programme and ECDA’s national ‘Start Small, Dream Big’ (SSDB) initiative bring the elderly and young together through meaningful activities, to help build bonds and foster a deeper understanding between different generations and backgrounds.

In FY2022, our intergenerational programmes saw an expansion in the number of collaborations between our key partners, namely the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots Preschools, Community Chest, and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). We also increased engagement opportunities with Community Care Organisations (CCOs) through activities between pre-schoolers and seniors.

Compared to 2021, we are pleased to note that the number of engagements for both the AIC-PCF and SSDB initiatives have increased in 2022.

To drive CHAS uptake and utilisation in 2022, AIC Primary Care ran a multi-pronged digital campaign in July and August, raising awareness on the expansion of the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). 

The digital campaign comprised a collaboration with SGAG, and was rolled out on TikTok and through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. A [series of blog articles](https://aic-blog.com/chronic-condition-management) on a CHAS GP team and their patient with a chronic conditions was also produced and amplified on AIC’s social channels.
