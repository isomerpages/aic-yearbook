# Supporting the community
**Caregiving is a shared responsibility that starts with everyone in the community. We took active strides last year to make mental health care more accessible, and to encourage mental health support and treatments. We are also exploring service integrations to better empower our primary and community care partners to support well-being of our community.**

## Mental Health
### PCN-Mental Health
Mental health is an important part of one’s overall health and well-being. In line with Healthier SG, the shift towards population health aims to improve physical and mental health outcomes and reduce health inequalities across the entire population.  

General Practitioners and polyclinics aim to bring care closer to home and improve seniors’ access to mental health services. For this, AIC worked closely with MOH and the Primary Care Networks (PCN) to develop PCN–Mental Health (PCN-MH), which will cater to the public’s needs through an integrated mental health network.

Consistent and quality nursing care across PCNs are key to supporting both seniors and caregivers holistically in the community. AIC is in the process of incorporating more mental health components and care within the PCN nurse training roadmap.

To better equip primary care professionals, AIC has put together additional mental health resources and shared support available to complement existing public-facing resources.

### Service integration between AAC and CREST
AIC identified the opportunity to increase awareness on Community Mental Health (CMH) services and activities among primary and community care partners by partnering AACs to better support the needs of the larger community. To aid the AACs and facilitate the process between AAC and CREST in referring cases, information about CREST and client workflows have been incorporated into the AAC operations guide.

## World Mental Health Day 2022
World Mental Health Day (WMHD) is commemorated annually on 10 October to raise awareness of mental well-being and to mobilise efforts in support of mental health.

Planned with the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-Being, the overarching theme for WMHD 2022 was ‘Stand Together for Mental Health’. The nation-wide campaign featured merchandise in the form of car decals, tote bags, and umbrellas specially designed by local artist Stephanie Raphaela Ho, a mental health activist who has lived with depression and anxiety.

Through the collaboration of the MCCY and the SG Mental Well-being Network, TheSmartLocal, a local media company was also engaged. Under this campaign, a documentary short film was produced, titled: ‘99 Singaporeans sharing their darkest moments’. The video aims to help the public know that they are not alone on their mental wellness journey, and that it is okay to seek help when needed.

## Dementia
### \#DementiaFriendlySG Movement
In November 2022, AIC officially launched an inaugural campaign to spearhead Singapore’s movement to build a more dementia-friendly nation. The movement was part of the Dementia-Friendly Singapore (DFSG) initiative, announced in 2016 by MOH to address the growing prevalence of the illness in Singapore. The #DementiaFriendlySG social movement rallies society at all levels – individuals, communities, and businesses, calling on each group to play a part in building a caring and dementia-friendly Singapore. 

Led by AIC and supported by 81 partners, the campaign hopes to spread the message on the importance of creating an inclusive society and advocated ways for the public to become a ‘Dementia Friend’ to support people living with dementia in their communities.

To further strengthen its efforts in building a Dementia-Friendly Singapore, AIC is actively collaborating with partners on various initiatives. This includes signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with AIC and Dementia Singapore (DSG). The MOU will see both organisations aligning their strategies to synergise efforts in capability building, communications, and support for persons living with dementia, as well as their caregivers. At the same time, initiatives and networks will be co-developed by engaging key stakeholders to meet emerging needs.

It is important for our ageing nation to build a caring and supportive environment for persons living with dementia, to enable them to continue living a fulfilling life in the community.
