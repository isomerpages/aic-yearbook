# Supporting caregivers
**Caregiving is an ongoing journey that places many responsibilities on the caregiver. To support them, AIC is working with various partners to develop and enhance resources.**

## Help for Helping Hands
### SupportGoWhere Caregiving Page
AIC has collaborated with ServiceSG and GovTech to create SupportGoWhere’s ‘Care Services Recommender’ to help caregivers to correctly identify the appropriate service or scheme that will be suitable for seniors under their care. This online resource help caregivers access the latest information, plan ahead, and get suitable assistance.

In November 2022, the new SupportGoWhere Caregivers Service Journey webpage was launched. The one-stop, multilingual platform helps caregivers identify the most accurate service or scheme using a simple assessment tool, helping them to efficiently find the best service for their charges. The page also lists a wide range of services targeted at care recipients and the postal codes for all the services.

### Enhanced Home Caregiving Grant
Introduced in 2019, the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) is disbursed to caregivers from lower-income families who are looking after their loved ones with permanent moderate disability. The payouts can be used to defray costs of caregiving expenses, such as the cost of caregiver support services in the community or hiring a foreign domestic worker.

Beneficiaries with a monthly household income of between S$1,201 and S$2,800 will receive S$250, up from S$200 previously.

The increased HCG payout is part of MOH’s overall efforts to help lighten the burden of caregivers from lower-income families and to recognise their contributions.
