# Preparing the Community Care Sector
**AIC continues to make care more accessible to seniors through its Active Ageing Centres (AACs) nationwide. The centres are go-to points for seniors and a resource hub for them to access comprehensive services and the latest information to navigate their needs, making them the perfect information depot to learn about Healthier SG and take their first step in adopting preventive healthcare.**

## Active Ageing Centres as Resource Hubs  
In the Healthier SG White Paper released in September 2022, it was highlighted that AACs would be involved in Healthier SG efforts, working closely with primary care physicians. This includes supporting seniors to follow through their health plans by (a) connecting them to social or lifestyle activities and (b) assisting them with community screening such as the self-monitoring of vital signs.

To build up AAC staff’s knowledge and skills, AIC introduced relevant training courses, which were attended by over 800 staff. In support of the Healthier SG launch, new courses such as the ‘Social Connector and Community-based Vital Signs Monitoring’ were also trialed in February and March 2023, in preparation for roll-out to all AACs thereafter.

AIC has also conducted several briefing-cum-sharing sessions with various divisions to discuss AAC's role in supporting the Healthier SG initiative. AIC will carry out more activities to engage with our Community Care partners as the AAC network continues to serve the senior communities in Singapore.
