# Preparing the Community Care Sector
**AIC continues to make community care more accessible to seniors through the onboarding of Active Ageing Centres around the nation. The centres are go-to points for seniors and a resource hub for them to access a suite of comprehensive services and the latest information to navigate their needs.**

## Onboarding Active Ageing Centres  
As part of national efforts to reduce social isolation and promote active ageing, we are working to establish Active Ageing Centres (AACs) and Active Ageing Centres (Care) throughout Singapore. 

AACs will serve as community hubs for seniors and will primarily deliver an ‘ABC’ suite of services -- Active ageing for well and active seniors, Befriending & buddying for seniors with no or limited social networks, and information and referral to Care services. At the same time, AACs (Care) will provide additional '2S' care services, including being a Social connector, offering community-based Vital Signs Monitoring connections, befriending and buddying services, and Care referrals. By 2025, the goal is to have 220 AACs following a population-based service model.

In the Healthier SG White Paper released in September 2022, it was highlighted that AACs would be involved in Healthier SG efforts, working closely with primary care physicians. This includes supporting seniors to follow through their health plans by (a) connecting them to social or lifestyle activities and (b) assisting them with community screening such as the self-monitoring of vital signs.

## Community Connector programme
To build up the knowledge and skills of AAC staff, we also developed and introduced relevant training courses and about 823 centre staff attended the courses. In support of the Healthier SG launch, new courses to support the launch of 2Ss were trialed in February and March 2023, to prepare for roll-out to all AACs from March onwards.

We also conducted several sharing-cum-briefing sessions with various divisions to discuss support areas for AACs. These sessions included sessions with the Healthier SG team and peer-to-peer sharing. To support the development of the AAC Service, AIC actively engaged with Community Care partners through the following activities:

More activities to engage with our Community Care partners will be carried out in the near future, as the AAC network continues to grow and thrive, serving the senior communities in Singapore.
