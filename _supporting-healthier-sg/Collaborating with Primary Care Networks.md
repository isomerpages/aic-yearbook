# Collaborating with Primary Care Networks
**In support of Healthier SG, AIC will collaborate with and support Primary Care Networks (PCNs) and General Practitioners (GPs) to guide them in their roles for this new initiative. Under the Primary Care Networks framework by the Ministry of Health, private GP clinics will form networks to support holistic and team-based care for patients. To back the Ministry’s strategy to move care beyond the hospital and to the community, AIC is supporting and encouraging the adoption of the Healthier SG scheme at a sector level.**

## Onboarding General Practitioners
We have prepared onboarding resources for General Practitioner clinics and their teams, to equip them in administering Healthier SG initiatives in their clinics. This has allowed the teams to familiarise themselves with the content and prepare them for the initiative ahead of its launch.

To increase efficiencies, AIC360 Touchpoints coordinates service delivery via a consolidated platform to reduce information asymmetry. It also gives Community Care Partners access to a holistic client landscape.
