# Collaborating with Primary Care Networks
**Under the Primary Care Networks framework by the Ministry of Health, private general practitioner clinics form networks to support holistic and team-based care for patients. To back the ministry’s strategy to move care beyond the hospital and to the community, AIC is supporting the adoption of the Healthier SG scheme.**

## Onboarding General Practitioners
We have prepared onboarding resources for general practitioner clinics and their teams, to equip them in administering Healthier SG initiatives in their clinics. This allowed the teams to familiarise themselves with the content and prepare them ahead of the launch.

To increase efficiencies, AIC360 Touchpoints coordinates service delivery via a consolidated platform to reduce information asymmetry. It also gives Community Care Partners access to a holistic client landscape.
