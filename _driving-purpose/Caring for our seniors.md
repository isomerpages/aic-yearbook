# Caring for our seniors
**AIC’s Silver Generation Office continue its outreach in engaging seniors, sharing about Healthier SG, and assisting with enrolment. A recruitment drive to strengthen SGO’s pool of Silver Generation Ambassadors was held in partnership with local Key Opinion Leaders and attracted a healthy number of volunteer sign-ups. To invite the next generation to help seniors age healthily, a meaningful collaboration was forged with the National University of Singapore, which piloted a module for students to be involved in SGO's work and befriend seniors.**

## Engaging our Seniors
Since April 2022, AIC’s Silver Generation Office (SGO) volunteers have engaged with thousands of Singapore’s seniors through their Preventive Health Visits (PHV) programme. The volunteers, known as Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGA), have been making rounds and visiting seniors in their homes, encouraging them to get their routine vaccinations and helping them enrol for Healthier SG, the nation’s latest health initiative.

## Senior Engagement Application
The Senior Engagement Application (SEA) is an online, senior-cum-volunteer management system developed by SGO. SGAs will log on to the system when they conduct physical or virtual engagement sessions with seniors.

In 2022, SEA facilitated the successful onboarding of over 1,500 SGAs. The SEA system also efficiently tracks all SGO volunteer's training progress towards being certified as an SGA for the Preventive Health Visit programme. In total, 2,762 SGAs have successfully undergone PHV training across 98 training sessions that were conducted.

With SEA, SGO is also able identify the number of hours SGAs have dedicated in supporting our seniors at a glance. In recognition of their contribution, a total of 478 SGAs received the Service Award; with 131 SGAs receiving the Gold award, 225 receiving the Silver award and 122 receiving the Bronze award.

SEA is constantly being improved and refined additional modules to improve engagement, planning, and volunteer deployment were added. SGAs can choose to connect with seniors in-person or virtually via the system’s Tele-Engagement option. Following the engagement, seniors are then referred and connected to relevant community partners to support their needs. 

In 2022, SGO has made over 3,800 referrals for seniors to engage in various active ageing programmes within their community, link them up to employment/volunteering opportunities and to encourage them to plan early for their future needs through ACP/LPA.
