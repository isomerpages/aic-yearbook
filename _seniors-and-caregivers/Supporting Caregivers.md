# Supporting caregivers
**Caregiving is an ongoing journey that places many responsibilities on the caregiver. To support them, AIC, together with ServiceSG and GovTech, has created SupportGoWhere’s ‘Care Services Recommender’ page, a helpful, all-in-one online resource to help caregivers access the most accurate and up-to-date information to find services or schemes available. MOH has also enhanced the Home Caregiving Grant, to accord more aid to lower-income families, which will help caregivers manage the daily and medical expenses of charges under their care.**

## Help for Helping Hands
### SupportGoWhere Caregiving Page
It is often challenging for caregivers to correctly identify the best service or scheme that will be suitable for seniors under their care. To support this, AIC has collaborated with ServiceSG and GovTech to create SupportGoWhere’s ‘Care Services Recommender’, to help caregivers access the latest information, plan ahead, and get assistance.

In November 2022, the new SupportGoWhere Caregivers Service Journey webpage was launched. The one-stop, multi-lingual platform helps caregivers identify the most accurate service or scheme using a simple assessment tool, helping them to efficiently find the best service for their charges and saving much time. The page also lists a wide range of services targeted at care recipients and the postal codes for all the services.

Since its launch, the team behind the webpage has embarked on a Usability Testing study and Focus Group sessions with citizens, agency groups, clinicians, medical social workers and service providers to make continuous improvements to the webpage.

### Enhanced Home Caregiving Grant
Introduced in 2019, the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG) is disbursed to caregivers from lower-income families who are looking after their loved ones with permanent moderate disability. The payouts can be used to defray costs of caregiving expenses, such as the cost of caregiver support services in the community or hiring a foreign domestic worker.

*@Creative team, please highlight the following stat call-outs with graphics:
The enhanced HCG will accord beneficiaries with no household income or a monthly household income of up to S$1,200 with double the support, from S$200 to up to S$400 per month.*

Beneficiaries with a monthly household income of between S$1,201 and S$2,800 will receive S$250, up from S$200 previously.

The increased HCG payout is part of MOH’s overall efforts to help lighten the burden of caregivers from lower-income families and to recognise their contributions.
