# Supporting seniors
**We expend every effort to care for our seniors, be it through on-going programmes that cater to their needs, such as Meals on Wheels, or by rolling out new initiatives, such as the Communities of Care pilot. Each enhancement to the existing support for our seniors is achieved by ramping up service delivery and raising awareness of Singapore’s ageing population through new partnerships.**

## Caring for their needs
### Meals on Wheels

AIC conducts assessments on MOW service to help identify and close any gaps in the meal preparation and delivery process.

### Community Case Management Service
In 2022, the Cluster Support (CS) programme was streamlined into the Community Case Management Service (CCMS) to provide support to seniors in the community who have difficulties managing their health and social care needs.

## Living well, ageing well
### Communities of Care
The pilot of AIC’s Communities of Care (CoC) programme was held from 2019 to 2023. Called ‘CoC 1.0’, it was developed to strengthen the construction of a place-based care ecosystem.

Through the pilot, various care providers worked together to create service networks by location, to best serve seniors within each community. Leveraging on each other’s strengths and resources enabled them to boost service delivery and gain valuable learnings.

With learnings from CoC 1.0, we developed a more structured approach for the construction of a localised care ecosystem known as CoC 2.0. The Tote Board Community Health Fund (TBCHF) has also committed to supporting the running CoC for another three years, from 2023 to 2026.
 
More pilot sites will be involved in CoC 2.0 for testing and adaptation of the strategies developed by the providers. The objective of this second chapter would be to create and implement a playbook that will support the scalability and replicability of building CoCs across all Active Aging Centres (AACs) island wide.

### Recruiting Silver Generation Ambassadors
From September to November 2022, a Recruitment Campaign was rolled out to strengthen our Silver Generation Office’s (SGO) current pool of Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGA). The campaign’s multi-touch amplification included displaying quotes from existing SGAs on Digital Display Panels at Housing Development Board estates, television screens at food courts and coffee shops, and across social media platforms, such as SGO’s Facebook and YouTube channels.

SGO also worked with local Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) like Belinda Lee, Chen Xi, Sujimy, Nurul Aini, and Guna, to further the campaign’s reach on social media. The KOLs contributed to the recruitment narrative by adding their own perspectives and documenting the journey of real-life SGAs, from receiving training to engaging seniors.

### Collaboration with NUS
In view of Singapore’s rapidly ageing population and their increasingly diverse needs, SGO collaborated with the National University of Singapore (NUS), to lead a pilot module, ‘GEN2061: Support Healthy Ageing SG’. 

As part of NUS’ Communities & Engagement Pillar, the module seeks to impart the fundamental concepts of volunteerism and enhance students’ understanding of helping seniors in their community age healthily.

In anticipation of seniors’ increasing care needs, SGO is currently actively reaching out to various Institutes of Higher Learning to engage students on the important role they play in Singapore’s ageing population landscape.

### Book feature: Singapore Ageing
SGO made its reach in the sphere of academia through SGO Tampines’ Deputy Head, Andrew Sim’s contribution to the book, ‘Singapore Ageing: Issues and Challenges Ahead’.

Andrew researched and co-authored a chapter called ‘Building a Social Network for Older Adults: A Nation-wide Initiative by the Singapore Silver Generation Office’. He wrote the text with Dr Corrine Ghoh, an Associate Professor from the Department of Social Work in NUS. The chapter chronicles the evolution of the Silver Generation Office and the positive impact it has made since its inception, through promoting positive ageing for the well-being of seniors in Singapore. 

The book, published by leading academic publisher World Scientific, serves as a useful resource for local students and international scholars who are interested in the socio-political discourse on ageing in Singapore.

### Enhancing Activity Access for Frailer Seniors
Physical, cognitive, and social activities bring well-being to everyone; however, access to suitable, meaningful activities for frailer seniors can be a challenge. 

To better enable frailer seniors’ participation in activities, AIC worked with partners to curate activities suitable for their interests and abilities at two key national events in 2022. 

## Promoting Intergenerational Engagement
### Intergenerational Programmes
The intergenerational collaborations under the AIC-PCF Intergenerational Programme and ECDA’s national ‘Start Small, Dream Big’ (SSDB) initiative bring the elderly and young together through meaningful activities, to help build bonds and foster a deeper understanding between different generations and backgrounds.

In FY2022, our intergenerational programmes saw an expansion in the number of collaborations between our key partners, namely the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) Sparkletots Preschools, Community Chest, and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). We also increased engagement opportunities with Community Care Organisations (CCOs) through activities between pre-schoolers and seniors.

Compared to 2021, we are pleased to note that the number of engagements for both the AIC-PCF and SSDB initiatives have increased in 2022.

## Providing financial assistance
### Enhanced Seniors’ Mobility & Enabling Fund
The Seniors' Mobility and Enabling Fund (SMF) provides holistic support for seniors to age in place within the community.

### Enhanced CHAS outreach
To drive CHAS uptake and utilisation in 2022, AIC Primary Care ran a multi-pronged digital campaign in July and August, raising awareness on the expansion of the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). 

The digital campaign comprised a collaboration with SGAG, and was rolled out on TikTok and through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. A series of blog articles on a CHAS GP team and their patient with a chronic conditions was also produced and amplified on AIC’s social channels. 

Additionally, we worked with MOH to weave in the Healthier SG messaging in our social media advertisements in March 2023.
