# Supporting seniors
**Healthier SG is a national initiative to help Singaporeans take steps towards better health and quality of life. With Healthier SG, all Singaporeans will have a family clinic to guide them to staying healthy, a customised Health Plan to support them in their health goals, and access to community programmes to help them stay active. To support seniors in this journey, we are building an ecosystem of support for them.**

## Engaging seniors on Healthier SG 
In support of Ministry of Health’s (MOH) efforts to gather feedback on planned Healthier SG reforms, we conducted 28 interviews with elderly residents in April and May of 2022. Known as the ‘Healthier SG - Resident Engagement’, the project yielded valuable insights that informed the Healthier SG White Paper, which will help guide future MOH policies and plans.

## Surveying sentiment
We initiated a collaboration between MOH and the Singapore Management University’s Centre for Research on Successful Ageing, to understand seniors' receptivity towards the Healthier SG initiative.

## Preventive Health Visits
Developed by AIC’s Silver Generation Office (SGO), Preventive Health Visits are engagements with ageing residents to nudge behavioural change towards preventive healthcare. The initiative seeks to understand what matters to seniors, and through a network of volunteers, connect seniors to the wider healthcare and community support system.

Since April 2022, SGO has also made the most of these engagements, sharing Healthier SG initiatives with them, getting their feedback, and assisting them with enrolment.

## Senior Engagement Application

The Senior Engagement Application (SEA) is a senior-cum-volunteer management system developed by SGO which SGAs log on to conduct physical engagement sessions with seniors.
