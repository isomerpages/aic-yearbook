# Supporting seniors

**Healthier SG is a national initiative to help Singaporeans take steps towards better health and quality of life. With Healthier SG, all Singaporeans will have a family clinic to guide them to staying healthy, a customised Health Plan to support them in their health goals, and access to community programmes to help them stay active. To support seniors in this journey, we are building an ecosystem of support for them. **

## Engaging seniors on Healthier SG 
In support of Ministry of Health’s (MOH) efforts to gather feedback on planned Healthier SG reforms, we conducted 28 interviews with elderly residents in April and May of 2022. Known as the ‘Healthier SG - Resident Engagement’, the project yielded valuable insights that informed the Healthier SG White Paper, which will help guide future MOH policies and plans.

## Surveying needs 
The Strategy, Research and Data Division also initiated a collaboration between MOH and the Singapore Management University’s Centre for Research on Successful Ageing (SMU ROSA), to understand seniors' receptivity towards the Healthier SG initiative.

## Preventive Health Visits
Developed by AIC’s Silver Generation Office (SGO), Preventive Health Visits are engagements with ageing residents to nudge behavioural change towards preventive healthcare. The initiative seeks to understand what matters to seniors, and through a network of volunteers, connect seniors to the wider healthcare and community support system.

Since April 2022, SGO has also made the most of these engagements, sharing Healthier SG initiatives with them, getting their feedback, and assisting them with enrolment.

> Over the past year, SGO’s volunteers, the Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGAs) has engaged with more than 228,000 seniors island wide. Of that, over 35,000 seniors attended ‘Project Silver Screen’ to check their vision, hearing, and oral health.

SGO has also scheduled home COVID-19 vaccinations for over 17,000 home-bound seniors and their family members and continue to encourage seniors to receive their influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations. Over 2,000 seniors have also been connected to Befriending and Care &amp; Support services in the community.

## Senior Engagement Application

The Senior Engagement Application (SEA) is a senior-cum-volunteer management system developed by SGO where Silver Generation Ambassadors (SGA) would login to the platform to conduct physical engagement sessions with seniors or to submit digital volunteer application and undertaking forms. Apart from tracking of all our volunteers’ training progress towards being certified for the Preventive Health Visit programme. SEA also enables the collection and analysis of senior profiles and trend data to preempt potential issues. Insights would be shared with healthcare providers and care partners such as Regional Health Systems and Active Ageing Centres. Additional modules to improve engagement planning and volunteer deployment were also added, and SGAs can connect with seniors in-person or virtually via Tele-Engagement. 

In 2022, SEA facilitated the successful onboarding of 1,568 Silver Generation Ambassadors

SEA has also been enhanced to retrieve HSG enrolment status of seniors to allow our SGAs to share HSG messaging during PHV if senior is unenrolled and guide seniors on how to enrol in HSG programme.
