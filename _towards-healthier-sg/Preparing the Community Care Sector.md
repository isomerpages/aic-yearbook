**The Primary and Community Care Development Division (PCDD) continues its efforts to make community care more accessible to seniors through the onboarding of Active Aging Centres (AACs) around the nation. The centres are go-to points for the elderly and a resource hub for them to access a suite of comprehensive services and the latest information to navigate their needs.**

## Onboarding Active Aging Centres  
As part of national efforts to reduce social isolation and promote active ageing, AIC is working to establish Active Ageing Centres (AACs) and Active Ageing Centres (Care) throughout Singapore. 

AACs will serve as community hubs for seniors and will primarily deliver an ‘ABC’ suite of services, and AACs (Care) will provide additional care services, including physical health improvement, mental well-being support, social connections, befriending and buddying services, and Care referrals. By 2025, the goal is to have 220 AACs following a population-based service model.

> Goal by 2025: To have 220 Active Ageing Centres (AACs) island wide.

In the Healthier SG White Paper released in September 2022, it was highlighted that AACs would be involved in Healthier SG efforts, working closely with primary care physicians. This includes supporting seniors to follow through their health plans by (a) connecting them to social or lifestyle activities and (b) assisting them with self-monitoring of vital signs.

> In 2022: 
> 
>	1.	59 new AAC centres offering ‘ABC’ services were onboarded, making the final total of AACs nationwide 119, on-track for 2025’s target.
> 
>	2.	An AAC IT Grant was introduced to help AACs ‘go digital’ – by strengthening procurement and enhancement of IT solutions so that AACs are better supported in their daily work.
> 
>	3.	The CareConnect platform was introduced to replace FormSG when AACs submit half-yearly progression reports and also to securely share seniors’ information to service providers.

## Community Connector programme
To build up the knowledge and skills of AAC staff, PCDD also developed and introduced relevant training courses and about 823 centre staff attended the courses. In support of the Healthier SG launch, new courses to support the launch of 2Cs, the ‘Community Connector and Community-based Vital Signs Monitoring’ programme were trialed in February and March 2023 with 72 centre staff, to prepare for roll-out to all AACs from March onwards.

Further, PCDD conducted several sharing-cum-briefing sessions with various divisions to discuss support areas for AACs. These sessions included sessions with HSG and peer-to-peer sharing. To support the development of the AAC Service Model, AIC actively engaged with Community Care partners through the following activities:

> 
> •	On 14 July 2022, 34 participants from 21 Community Care Organisations attended the ‘Focus Group Discussion with Community Care’ to discuss HSG objectives, service journey, and the expanded scope’s roles and relationships.
> 
> •	On 23 September 2022, the Communities of Practice for AACs launched ‘Kopi-AAC!’ – sessions where AAC partners come together to learn and share best practices and innovations with one another. More than 300 centre staff have attended these sessions.
> 
> •	On 5 December 2022, over 200 participants attended a session called ‘Preparing for the Next Bound of Aged Care - Update on Plans for AAC Service Model’ by MOH and AIC to discuss and share potential improvements to the AAC Service Model.
> 
> •	On 17 March 2023, more than 500 participants attended an onboarding webinar, ‘Implementation of Active Ageing Centre (AAC) service’ to learn about updates to the AACs service model, funding and grants, and to have a briefing on the Operations Guide. 

More activities to engage with our Community Care partners will be carried out in the near future, as the AAC network continues to grow and thrive, serving the senior communities in Singapore.
