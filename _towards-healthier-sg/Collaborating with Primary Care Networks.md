**Under the Primary Care Networks (PCN) framework by MOH, private General Practitioner (GP) clinics form networks to support holistic and team-based care for patients. To back MOH’s strategy to move care beyond the hospital and to the community, AIC Primary Care is supporting the adoption of the Healthier SG scheme by GPs and continues to amplify the benefits of enrolling into the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) through digital and on-ground channels.**

## Onboarding General Practitioners

AIC Primary Care has prepared onboarding resources for GP clinics and their teams (administrative, IT and operations) to adopt the Healthier SG scheme. To date, about 800 GP clinics have chosen to be part of the HSG scheme!


These helpful resources include structured HSG onboarding training sessions (beginning in May 2023) and equipping all clinics with an HSG Onboarding Kit in June. The information provided will equip GP clinics and their staff in administering Healthier SG initiatives in their clinics, allowing teams to familiarise themselves with the content and be prepared ahead of the launch in July.

The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) enables all Singaporeans to receive subsidies for medical and/or dental care at participating GP and dental clinics. To drive CHAS uptake and utilisation in 2022, AIC Primary Care ran a multi-pronged digital campaign from July to August, raising awareness on the expansion of the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP). 

The digital campaign comprised a collaboration with SGAG, and was rolled out on TikTok and through advertisements on Facebook and Instagram. An AIC blog article on a CHAS GP team and their patient with a chronic condition was also produced and amplified on AIC’s social channels.

Additionally, we worked with MOH to weave in the Healthier SG messaging in our social media advertisements in March 2023, and produced a TikTok video featuring a senior encouraging caregivers to assist their parents and grandparents to apply for CHAS ahead of Healthier SG’s launch in July. As of 31 March this year, more than 2.1 million people have been successfully onboarded to the CHAS programme.

As part of our enhanced CHAS outreach efforts, physical events are also back, first with the launching of the new CHAS portal in May 2022 and the resumption of our CHAS public roadshows all over Singapore from August 2022.
