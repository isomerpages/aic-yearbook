# Building skills and strategies
**We continue to focus our efforts on enriching the talent pool and bench-strength of our people through various leadership programmes and initiatives. A structured pathway was launched for Senior Nurses and Nurse Managers to train them to assume leadership positions. At the same time, an enhanced AIC Learning Network takes shape as more courses are progressively added for the benefit of our care partners.**

## AIC leadership-building programmes
The IMPACT and INSIGHT Leadership programmes are part of AIC’s initiatives to provide a series of customised programme and pathway to grow the leadership pipeline and bench strength in the Community Care sector. More than 100 leaders and managers have attended and benefitted from these Leadership Milestone programmes. 

AIC sends one leader from the Community Care sector each year to attend Harvard Business School’s ‘Strategic Perspective in Non-profit Management’ programme. This programme is a partnership between Harvard Singapore Foundation and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.

Targeted at top executives of non-profits, the programme explores crucial concepts and skills for non-profit leadership. It also looks into strengthening management and accountability while leading the evolution for a more responsive, successful, and sustainable organisation.

## Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme
The Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme (CCNLP) was developed to facilitate succession planning and strengthen the pipeline of nursing leaders for the Community Care sector. It aims to build up the nursing leadership bench-strength through a structured pathway.

Since January 2022, AIC has also facilitated CCNLP peer networking sessions for successfully on-boarded nursing talents to bond, share their experiences, and network with dedicated AIC Talent Partners. The sessions are held on a quarterly basis and include dialogues with nursing leaders on their leadership journey. Nursing talents can have meaningful conversations on any queries or concerns they may have regarding their own journeys.

Additionally, MOH and AIC are also working with participating CCOs to develop Individual Development Plans to track the development and progression of their nursing talents in accordance with the Community Nursing Competency Framework.

Since the launch of the Community Care Learning Management System (CCLMS) to encourage self-directed e-learning, we have streamlined and improved the user experience to meet the needs of sector workforce through annual system enhancements. New enhancements will be rolled out to improve user management functionality and governance in alignment to SkillsFuture Singapore’s Continuing Education and Training Grants Governance Framework.
