**Message from our Chairman
Dr Gerard Ee**

We live in a time where public health improvements and medical advances have resulted in people having longer lifespans. To enjoy a good quality of life in our golden years, we must continue to keep ourselves active and healthy.
Healthier SG seeks to do just that â€” by empowering Singaporeans to take charge of their own health, with the support of a dedicated family doctor. 
Introduced in 2022 and publicly launched in July 2023, Healthier SG represents a national mindset shift from curative to preventive healthcare. For us at AIC, it marks an exciting development that will propel us to achieve our vision of building a vibrant care community for people to live well and age gracefully. 
As the national care aggregator, we work closely with community and service partners on the ground to ensure that seniors and caregivers receive holistic, wrap-around care. We now have an even clearer mandate to strengthen our sector ties and reinforce care delivery so that seniors are supported and empowered to age in place. 
Already, our Silver Generation Office has engaged more than 228,000 seniors through Preventive Health Visits to understand their needs, share how Healthier SG can benefit them, and help them with enrolment. In tandem, we are onboarding General Practitioners and equipping them with the resources they need to take on the role of family doctors while preparing the Community Care sector and Active Ageing Centres to support seniors in following through with their health plans. 
There is no doubt that Healthier SG is a long journey. We have taken the first steps in the right direction, and we have much more to do. It will take the concerted effort of the entire system to achieve better health outcomes for every Singaporean. Together, we can build a stronger Singapore and a healthier future for all.
