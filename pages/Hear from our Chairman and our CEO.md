**Message from our Chairman
Dr Gerard Ee**

We live in a time where public health improvements and medical advances have resulted in people having longer lifespans. To enjoy a good quality of life in our golden years, we must continue to keep ourselves active and healthy.
Healthier SG seeks to do just that — by empowering Singaporeans to take charge of their own health, with the support of a dedicated family doctor. 
Introduced in 2022 and publicly launched in July 2023, Healthier SG represents a national mindset shift from curative to preventive healthcare. For us at AIC, it marks an exciting development that will propel us to achieve our vision of building a vibrant care community for people to live well and age gracefully. 
As the national care aggregator, we work closely with community and service partners on the ground to ensure that seniors and caregivers receive holistic, wrap-around care. We now have an even clearer mandate to strengthen our sector ties and reinforce care delivery so that seniors are supported and empowered to age in place. 
Already, our Silver Generation Office has engaged more than 228,000 seniors through Preventive Health Visits to understand their needs, share how Healthier SG can benefit them, and help them with enrolment. In tandem, we are onboarding General Practitioners and equipping them with the resources they need to take on the role of family doctors while preparing the Community Care sector and Active Ageing Centres to support seniors in following through with their health plans. 
There is no doubt that Healthier SG is a long journey. We have taken the first steps in the right direction, and we have much more to do. It will take the concerted effort of the entire system to achieve better health outcomes for every Singaporean. Together, we can build a stronger Singapore and a healthier future for all.


**Message from our Chief Executive Officer 
Mr Tan Kwang Cheak**

At the rate Singapore is currently ageing, by 2030, 1 in 5 people will be above 65 years old. This adds greater significance — and weight — to the work that we do at AIC, as our aim is to enable Singaporeans to age well in place. 

As Singapore embraces Healthier SG, we are undergoing our own transformation within AIC to ensure that our people are equipped with the future-ready mindset that we will need to take Singapore forward. 

In the past year, we have established an organisation-wide framework to drive greater efficiency and productivity across three focus areas — people, processes, and systems. We have taken strides to strengthen our care bench-strength and invest in talent development. This is all with the view of supporting our people’s professional growth and enriching their career journeys with us. One of these initiatives is ‘Walk in Your Shoes’, where staff members from various teams shadow each other at work, enabling our people to have more inter-team learning, partnership, and engagement opportunities.

Our transformation is also built on the adoption of innovative technology and no-code digital tools. We have on-boarded a suite of ‘Green Lane’ digital solutions to facilitate business integration across our organisation. These will equip our people with the capabilities to explore new frontiers and bring their solutions to life. Paired with new initiatives such as the FUN! Fund, which encourages our partners in the sector to come up with innovative ideas to improve the well-being of seniors, it reflects our continuous efforts in strengthening and evolving our care capabilities.

While we work as #OneAICFamily to fulfil our mission building a robust and connected care community, we must not forget that care needs of those we serve are not static. Along with longer lifespans, we must be ready to adapt and cater to changing lifestyles, societal norms, behaviours and expectations. 

AIC’s transformation journey will continue to unfold in parallel with, and in full support of, Singapore’s Healthier SG journey. Both paths will lead us towards better health outcomes for all Singaporeans, and that is exactly what we strive for.
