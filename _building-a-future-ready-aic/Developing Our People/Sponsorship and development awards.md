# Sponsorship and Development Awards

We believe that our people are at the core of delivering our mission, and making a difference to our clients, partners and stakeholders. In the past year, we continued to invest in staff development efforts, and enhanced our people development framework.  
  
Through careful review and curation of training programmes in emerging areas such as preventive health, social health integration and behavioural insights, we provide our employees with avenues to sharpen their development journeys. This was carried out through their individual learning roadmaps in close alignment with their personal and professional development priorities.
