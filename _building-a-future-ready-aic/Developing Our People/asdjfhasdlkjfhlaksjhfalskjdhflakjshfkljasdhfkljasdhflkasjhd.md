# Leveraging Our Employee's Diverse Skillsets
![alt text](/images/highlight.png)

The Corporate Project Team (CPT) is a new purpose-led initiative started in May 2021. It was designed to leverage our employeesâ€™ diverse skillsets, perspectives and knowledge, to address key issues across AIC and the sector. As an integral part of our talent development framework, CPTs provide employees with exposure to the wide range of work that we do and allow them to deepen their sense of ownership to corporate-level issues.

Three CPTs, comprising a total of 30 members, were piloted in May 2021. All three teams successfully delivered on their agreed objectives within six months and generated robust recommendations that have been taken onboard for consideration in 2022.
